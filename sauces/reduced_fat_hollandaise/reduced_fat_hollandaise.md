# Reduced-fat Hollandaise sauce

# Ingredients
* 2 Egg yolks
* 2 tbsp butter
* 2 tsp lemon juice
* Dash of desired seasoning

# Instructions
1. Heat water in a small pot and find a bowl to rest on the pot (insulating material is best), water should not touch bowl
2. Melt butter
3. Separate egg yolks into bowl
4. Add lemon juice to bowl, whisk to incorporate into yolks (flat whisk works well)
5. Whisk well until mixture is warm, light yellow, foamy, and doubled in size
6. Remove from heat and whisk in seasonings
7. Continue whisking and slowly pour in melted butter

8. If sauce gets too thick, I like to add 1-2 tsp of cold milk
